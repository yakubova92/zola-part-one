## notes
I had an interesting bug; clicking one of the filter radio buttons makes the other ones disappear. I'm not sure why this is happening; it only happened after refactoring. If you would like to see the code before refactoring, I have a component called combined.js. I thought this might be helpful as you are not able to see commits to git.
